# fleeing-points-clock

An interactive clock made of steering vehicles! Watch the time pass as you see these little squares re-arrenge themselves to display the current time! Hover your mouse over
the numbers if you want to see some magic happen. The site is live [here](https://devtony101.github.io/fleeing-points-clock/index).

As a little bonus you can also hit "ENTER" to randomize the colors of each square!

## Inspiration

This is a project based on @shiffman's coding challenge [Steering Behaviors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hA7G3gup-4).
